# 3D Graphics

This project demonstrates the implementation of a 3D graphics engine built entirely from scratch using c++ in visual studio. It showcases the rendering of two spheres with accurate reflections and shading.

- Ray-sphere intersection
- Lambertian Reflection
- Diffuse Materials
- Antialiasing
- Customizable scenery

The program simulates complex light behavior in a 3D world, capturing all of this in a final rendered image.

Used the "RayTracing in One Weekend" textbook as a guide.
